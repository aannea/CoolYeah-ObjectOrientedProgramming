# Object-Oriented Programming

I learned Object-Oriented-Programming with Java language

## 001_HelloWord.java
This file contains Java code to display Hello World

## 002_Print.java
The code above represents a simple Java program that declares several variables and prints their values. It provides information about an individual, including their name, age, blood type, height, weight, and gender.

## 003_Calculate.java
The code above is a Java program that allows the user to calculate the areas of different shapes based on their choices. It uses a menu-driven approach to prompt the user for their selection and gathers the necessary input to perform the calculations.
The available options are:
- Triangle Area: Prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and calculates its area using the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height.
- Circle Area: Asks the user to provide the radius of the circle and computes its area using the formula: area = π * radius^2, where π is a constant value obtained from the Math class.
- Square Area: Requests the user to input the length of a side of the square and determines its area by squaring the side length.
- Rectangle Area: Takes input for the length and width of the rectangle and calculates its area by multiplying these two values.
- Exit: Terminates the program and displays a "Goodbye" message.

## 004_ClassObjectConstructor.java
This Java program consists of two classes: Main and Buku. The Main class serves as the entry point of the program, containing the main method. The Buku class represents a book and defines its attributes and behavior. Let's break down the code further
Main.java:
The Main class:
- Serves as the entry point of the program.
- Creates an instance of the Buku class named a.
- Calls the setNilai method on the a object to set the values for the book's title, author, and quantity.
- Calls the cetakKeLayar method on the a object to display the book's information on the screen.
Buku.java:
The Buku class:
- Represents a book.
- Defines three private attributes: judul (title), pengarang (author), and jumlah (quantity).
- Provides a setNilai method that takes parameters for the title, author, and quantity and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.
- Provides a cetakKeLayar method that prints the book's title, author, and quantity to the screen.
In summary:
- The Main class creates an instance of the Buku class and sets its attributes using the setNilai method.
- The Buku class encapsulates the data and behavior related to a book, allowing for easy manipulation and display of its information.
