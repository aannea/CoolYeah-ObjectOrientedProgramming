# Object-Oriented Programming

I learned Object-Oriented-Programming with Java language

## 001_HelloWord.java
This file contains Java code to display Hello World

## 002_Print.java
The code above represents a simple Java program that declares several variables and prints their values. It provides information about an individual, including their name, age, blood type, height, weight, and gender.

## 003_Calculate.java
The code above is a Java program that allows the user to calculate the areas of different shapes based on their choices. It uses a menu-driven approach to prompt the user for their selection and gathers the necessary input to perform the calculations.
The available options are:
- Triangle Area: Prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and calculates its area using the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height.
- Circle Area: Asks the user to provide the radius of the circle and computes its area using the formula: area = π * radius^2, where π is a constant value obtained from the Math class.
- Square Area: Requests the user to input the length of a side of the square and determines its area by squaring the side length.
- Rectangle Area: Takes input for the length and width of the rectangle and calculates its area by multiplying these two values.
- Exit: Terminates the program and displays a "Goodbye" message.
